Log-Gaussian Cox point process model
- Run Demo_AIS.m for a demonstration of annealed importance sampling 
- Run Demo_cSMC.m for a demonstration of the proposed methodology
- Run Repeat_AIS.m and Repeat_cSMC.m to compare performance between AIS 
  and cSMC; this generates some result files saved in the .mat format 
- TrueLogNormConst.mat is taken as the reference truth, computed using 
  many repetitions of a SMC method with a large number of particles
- Run AnalyseResults.m to view the results
