These folders contain MATLAB code implementing the numerical results of the arXiv report "Controlled Sequential Monte Carlo
", by Jeremy Heng, Adrian Bishop, George Deligiannidis and Arnaud Doucet.

The StateSpaceModels/ and StaticModels/ folders contain subfolders that correspond to each numerical example. 
Each subfolder has a README.txt file that will explain how to run the scripts therein.
