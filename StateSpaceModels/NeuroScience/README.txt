- Run Demo.m for a demonstration of the proposed methodology
- Run Smoothing_FFBS.m and Smoothing_cSMC.m to perform smoothing using 
  FFBS and cSMC respectively
- Run Smoothing_Results.m to compare the results 
- Run NormConst_BPF.m and NormConst_cSMC.m to investigate how the relative 
  variance of marginal likelihood estimates produced by BPF and cSMC 
  respectively vary with the noise parameter 
- Run NormConst_Results to compare the results
- Run PMMH_BPF.m and PMMH_cSMC.m to perform PMMH using BPF and cSMC 
  respectively to compute the Metropolis-Hastings acceptance probabilities
- Run PMMH_Results.m to view the results
