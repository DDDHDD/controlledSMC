Lorenz-96 model
- Run Demo.m for a demonstration of the proposed methodology
- Run APF_VaryF.m and cSMC_VaryF.m to investigate how the relative variance 
  of marginal likelihood estimates produced by APF and cSMC respectively 
  vary with the forcing parameter 
- Run Repeat_Dim8.m Repeat_Dim16.m Repeat_Dim32.m Repeat_Dim64.m to 
  examine how the relative variance vary with observation noise and 
  dimension
- Run AnalyseResults.m to view the results
