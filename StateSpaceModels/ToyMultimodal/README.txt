Non-linear multimodal state space model
- Run Demo.m for a demonstration of the proposed methodology
- Run Repeat.m to investigate how performance of BPF and cSMC vary with 
  the observation noise parameter; this uses the simulated datasets stored 
  in this folder for reproducibility
- Run AnalyseResults.m to summarize results
